Lists
-----

Lists UI consists of the following screens:

-	List
-	Lists

### List

List should allow CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) actions on an individual List. A List is a composite consisting of Lists and ListItems. A List is often used for menus.

To construct the List it should be possible to simply Drag'n drop Lists and List items into a list of entries and reorder them as needed.

A list can be previewed using one or more Layout templates.

### Lists

The Lists screen shows multiple Lists and allows Drag'n drop of entries between Lists.
