Objects
-------

Objects UI consists of the following screens:

-	Object
-	Objects

### Object

Object should allow CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) actions on an individual Object. An Object is a Hash where each key can point to either a Block or an Image.

To construct the image it should be possible to simply Drag'n drop Images and Blocks into a list of entries. Each Image/Block has a name on its own, and the entry should use that name by default. However the Object must allow override of the name used for the key by a simple inline input.

An Object can be previewed using one or more Layout templates.

### Objects

The Objects screen shows multiple objects and allows Drag'n drop of entries between Objects.
